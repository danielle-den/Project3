# Project3

There are 2 different datasets for this project. The first dataset, which is within the foler, "Results", was performed on the RPI provided Lenovo Thinkpad laptop. It was performed using the "Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows" CLI, downloaded from the Windows Store. The second dataset, "VM_Results", was performed using an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS virtual machine running on VirtualBox on the same Lenovo as the previous dataset. This information is important because the latency for between both datasets are radically different, so it was necessary to give the disclaimer.
